/*
Q.1. You are given a starting position for a rat which is stuck in a maze at an initial 
point (0, 0) (the maze can be thought of as a 2-dimensional plane). The maze would be given 
in the form of a square matrix of order 'N' * 'N' where the cells with value 0 represent 
the mazeâ€™s blocked locations while value 1 is the open/available path that the rat can take 
to reach its destination. The rat's destination is at ('N' - 1, 'N' - 1). Your task is to 
find all the possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination in 
the maze. The possible directions that it can take to move in the maze are 'U'(up) i.e. (x, y - 1) , 
'D'(down) i.e. (x, y + 1) , 'L' (left) i.e. (x - 1, y), 'R' (right) i.e. (x + 1, y).

Note:
Here, sorted paths mean that the expected output should be in alphabetical order.
For Example:
Given a square matrix of size 4*4 (i.e. here 'N' = 4):
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 
Expected Output:
DDRDRR DRDDRR 
i.e. Path-1: DDRDRR and Path-2: DRDDRR

The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths, i.e. DRDDRR and DDRDRR 
when printed in sorted order, we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 5
0 <= MATRIX[i][j] <= 1

Where N is the size of the square matrix.

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1:
4
1 0 0 0 
1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1
Sample Output 1:
DDRDRR DRDDRR
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths, i.e. DRDDRR and DDRDRR when printed in sorted order, we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.
Sample Input 2:
2
1 0
1 0
Sample Output 2:
[]
Explanation For Sample Input 2:
As no valid path exists in Sample input 2 so we return an empty list.
